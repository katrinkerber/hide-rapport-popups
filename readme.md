# Hide Rapport reminder pop-ups
This is a very simple Chrome extension that hides the Rapport reminder pop-ups on the HSBC Business Banking login page.

It's a couple of lines of CSS which hide the pop-up overlays.

## Installation
To install this extension, download the files of this repository, un-zip them and save them somewhere suitable.

Then open Chrome and go to the Extensions page. Tick the **Developer mode** checkbox at the top right of the page and then select the **Load unpacked extensions...** button. Browse to where you have saved the extension's directory and select it. You should now see the extension added to the list and the Rapport pop-ups should be no more.

Go forth and [rejoice](http://replygif.net/i/675.gif).
